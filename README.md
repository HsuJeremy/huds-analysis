# HUDS Analysis

A collection of scripts that fetch Harvard University Dining Services (HUDS)
data from the [CS 50 Public API](https://cs50.readthedocs.io/api/dining/) and
aggregate them into interactive visualizations. These scripts were originally
written to create visualizations for our Harvard Open Data Project (HODP) comp
project in Spring 2021, where we studied the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic
on menu offerings at Harvard dining locations.
